APACHE HTTP SERVER is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation, Apache is an open source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customized to meet the needs of many different environments by using extensions and modules. Most WordPress hosting providers use Apache as their web server software. However, websites and other applications can run on other web server software as well. Such as  Nginx and Microsoft IIS

 sudo apt install apache2
